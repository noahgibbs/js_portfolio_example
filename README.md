# A Sample JavaScript Portfolio

Cut down from my personal one until there's just simple bits left.

Search for "http://google.com" and JANE DOE to find the bits that need to be
customized to you.

## Adding Projects

There's a div at the bottom which you can copy and paste as many times as you
like.

The "tags" data field is used to specify that it's a portfolio entry, but
doesn't do anything else.

You can fill in the other fields (Dates, Description, Tools, Role,
Organization.) There's nothing subtle there -- fill in the blanks, hit
"reload" in your browser, see the results.

The "Pictures" images and links should be in a specific format. Cut and
paste the existing ones and you should be fine.

## Do I Have to Know JavaScript?

Not really. There's nothing complicated here if you *do* know JavaScript, but
you can get away with knowing essentially no JavaScript and just cut-and-pasting
your way through.

## Debugging

To debug this, point your browser at the local file:// URL. For
instance, under my local source directory, that URL looks like this:

file:///Users/noah.gibbs/src/port_example/index.html
